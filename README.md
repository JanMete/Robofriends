My first Create React App. Initially, I learned how to create an object-based React app. Then, I converted the project to use useState. Here, I learned how to create components, how to pass props to components, and how to use useEffect. I practiced creating components using the map method and filtering them with filter.

Project created during my "The Complete Web Developer" course created by Andrei Neagoie on udemy platform where I learned basics of how the internet works, React, rest API, Express and PosgreSQL.
